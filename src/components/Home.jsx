          InventoHub: Reimagining Innovation and IP Commercialization for the Next Century
        </h1>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          At <strong>InventoHub – Inventing Tomorrow</strong>, we are not just building a platform — we are architecting a new ecosystem for invention, innovation, and intellectual property (IP) success.
          In a world where over <strong>95% of the 2 million patents</strong> granted annually are never commercialized, and where only 1 in 10 ideas reach the patent stage due to lack of resources,
          we see a massive untapped reservoir of human potential and ingenuity. <br /><br />
          Our mission is to unlock this potential.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          InventoHub exists to democratize innovation and create an equitable marketplace for inventors, IP professionals, and industry stakeholders.
          Our platform aims to bridge the chasm between bright ideas and market-ready solutions — from filing a patent to forming strategic licensing partnerships.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-amber-800">What We Aim to Achieve:</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          <li>
            Transform the patent-to-market journey by building the most accessible, transparent, and efficient IP support ecosystem globally.
          </li>
          <li>
            Empower inventors and startups with access to IP experts, funding pathways, legal frameworks, and commercialization networks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reverse the global imbalance in patent activity — where today, China and the USA account for 70% of all patents, and most of the world is underrepresented.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a living marketplace for ideas, where IP doesn’t just sit in databases — it finds collaborators, buyers, investors, and real-world applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring together the best brains in the country — scientists, technologists, legal experts, venture builders, and industry veterans — to co-create the future of innovation infrastructure.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-amber-800">Our Invitation:</h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          We are calling on visionary partners, investors, institutions, and professionals who share our belief that innovation should not be gated by geography, capital, or bureaucracy.
          Let’s build a new standard where every great idea, regardless of its origin, has a fair shot at making a global impact.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed font-medium italic">
          InventoHub is more than a platform. It’s a movement.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Let’s rewrite the story of invention — together.
