        <h1>InventoHub: Reimagining Innovation and IP Commercialization for the Next Century</h1>
        <p>At InventoHub- Inventing Tomorrow , we are not just building a platform — we are architecting a new ecosystem for invention, innovation, and intellectual property (IP) success.

In a world where over 95% of the 2 million patents granted annually are never commercialized, and where only 1 in 10 ideas reach the patent stage due to lack of resources, we see a massive untapped reservoir of human potential and ingenuity. Our mission is to unlock this potential.

InventoHub exists to democratize innovation and create an equitable marketplace for inventors, IP professionals, and industry stakeholders. Our platform aims to bridge the chasm between bright ideas and market-ready solutions — from filing a patent to forming strategic licensing partnerships.</p>
